  Vancouver is a beautiful and multicultural city. In this spectacular city, there are different types of food that could be found. People from other countries even state that their native food in Vancouver is more delicious than in their native countries. According to Food Services Industry, there are more than 5,000 restaurants in Greater Vancouver right now. There are: American, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Korean…etc. In this case, the residents in Vancouver usually face a serious question during the lunch and dinner time: What should I eat today? Therefore, I decided to create this map: Vancouver Top 10 Restaurants. In this map, 10 of the best restaurants are listed, and the clear detail is also displayed to help the map users to make their best decision. This map could potentially save the users’ time on deciding what to eat. 
  
  For the stylings, the basic template is chosen to display the map. Most of the users of this map simply just need the information and location of the restaurants in Vancouver. Therefore, basic template would be easier for the users to view and operate. Meanwhile, I tend to keep the map components such as roads, buildings, and labels as simple as possible, so the users can mainly focus on their point of interest. In order to let the map work at more than one zoom level, the added points are set to style across zoom page.

  To ensure that the map is visually comfortable for the map users, I consider the cartographic principal introduced in Amy Lee’s The Guide to Map Design. The concepts such as color consistency and typography are used as guidelines in this map to improve the quality. The color arrangement in this map is set to keep the map outlook as simple as possible. The fonts and size of labels are adjusted to fit the map perfectly. In order to improve the map, more cartographic principal and concepts should be used. Meanwhile, the points of interest should be more concise and detailed for better quality for the map users.
